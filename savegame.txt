Progress:Glad to see you’re up, nick. You’ve been out for a while…
Why don’t you try to "look around"?
A faint torch flickers outside, barely illuminating your stone-walled, windowless cell. The heavy door and rusted bars stand between you and the hallway.Why don’t you try to [push] the {door}?
You push against it, but it does not budge

Quite the optimist, aren’t you? 
Did you honestly expect it to be that simple? 
You have to try harder than that. Why don’t you more closely 
“examine the door”?
Due to your only light source being outside of your cell, 
you cannot visually make out any details on the cell-side of the door. 
You reach out to touch it and find it to be cold, hard, and solid. 
You find no cracks, gaps, or holes.

What moronic builder would design a cell door that can be opened from the inside? 
Come on… You’re better than this. I thought you would immediately 
“examine the door’s exterior” instead.
You slip your hands through the bars and run your hand across the door. 
You feel some sort of latch. You try to pull on it but to no avail. 
You run your hands across it and feel some sort of hole. 
You suspect it’s a keyhole.

There you go. Now, you have a goal. I’m curious to see how you get out… 
I look forward to seeing how you do. Good luck, friend.
To review, you can quickly grasp your surroundings by “looking around”. 
You can more closely examine something by “examining” the object.
